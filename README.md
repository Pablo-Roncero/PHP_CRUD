# PHP_CRUD
This repository contains a CRUD coded in PHP. 

## Introduction
The aim of the project was to complete a basic CRUD coded in PHP using OOP and the PDO class as a practice. 
This repository only includes the files to make this CRUD works, but it does not contain the database's table. 
As a way to describe the table's structure, it is a four columns table with the following fields: Id, Nombre, Apellido, Direccion 
(Name, Last name, Address).

## Technologies
The programming languages used on this project are PHP, SQL and CSS. The database is a MariaDB in an Apache server, al packed in a xampp
package. 

## Launch
Despite lacking of a table, the whole CRUD may be launched through the index.php file.

## Future Perspectives
The idea is to keep improving this CRUD in order to make it more complete and useful. Thus, some new uploads will be coming soon.
